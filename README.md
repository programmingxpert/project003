# Project003

A sleek, aesthetic anti-raid bot. Coded under pressure, ghosted under silence ‚Äî Open Sourced out of pure spite.

## About

This is a highly configurable, aesthetic Anti-Raid Bot built using Python and \`discord.py\`.

Originally commissioned under a tight deadline, this bot was coded from scratch ‚Äî with me learning \`discord.py\` at warp speed, despite being more comfortable with \`discord.js\`. After some serious midnight grind sessions, the commissioner ghosted me.

So, out of sheer pettiness (and pride), I decided to make it Open Source. You're welcome.
