# Project003

A sleek, aesthetic anti-raid bot. Coded under pressure, ghosted under silence — Open Sourced out of pure spite.

About
This is a highly configurable, aesthetic Anti-Raid Bot built using Python and discord.py.

Originally commissioned under a tight deadline, this bot was coded from scratch — with me learning discord.py at warp speed, despite being more comfortable with discord.js. After some serious midnight grind sessions, the commissioner ghosted me.
So, out of sheer pettiness (and pride), I decided to make it Open Source.
You're welcome.

## Features:
- ✨ Aesthetic responses and UI

- 🛡️ Powerful anti-raid protection
