# project003 - Anti-Raid Bot

A sleek, aesthetic anti-raid bot. Coded under pressure, ghosted under silence — Open Sourced out of pure spite.

## About

This is a highly configurable, aesthetic Anti-Raid Bot built using Python and `discord.py`.

Originally commissioned under a tight deadline, this bot was coded from scratch — with me learning `discord.py` at warp speed, despite being more comfortable with `discord.js`. After some serious midnight grind sessions, the commissioner ghosted me.
So, out of sheer pettiness (and pride), I decided to make it Open Source.
You're welcome.
